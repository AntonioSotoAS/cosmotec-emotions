   - Provide detailed description
   - Use appropriate labels

2. **Fork and Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
   ```

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
   Then create a Pull Request on GitHub.

## üéØ Coding Standards

### Python Style Guide
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add docstrings to all functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and small
- Use type hints where appropriate

### Code Example
```python
def analyze_emotional_state(emotions: dict, confidence: float) -> tuple[str, str]:
    """
    Analyze emotional state based on detected emotions.
    
    Args:
        emotions: Dictionary of emotion probabilities
        confidence: Confidence level of emotion detection
        
    Returns:
        Tuple of (state, description)
    """
    if not emotions or len(emotions) == 0:
        return "unknown", "No emotional data"
    
    # Implementation here...
    return state, description
```

### File Organization
- Keep related functions together
- Use clear module names
- Separate configuration from logic
- Document complex algorithms

## üß™ Testing

### Test Requirements
- All new features must include tests
- Maintain at least 80% code coverage
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Include integration tests for API endpoints

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run specific test file
pytest test_camera.py

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=reconocimiento_antonio
```

### Test Structure
```python
def test_face_recognition():
    """Test facial recognition functionality."""
    # Setup
    known_faces = load_test_faces()
    
    # Test
    result = recognize_faces(test_image, known_faces)
    
    # Assert
    assert result[0] == "antonio"
    assert result[1] > 0.8
```

## üìö Documentation
